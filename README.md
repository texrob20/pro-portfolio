Robert's Coding Portfolio Page

This is the Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio Challenge for the UTSA Coding Bootcamp.  The site contains four sections (header, about me, work portolio, and contact information).  In addition, there is a link to a sample resume.

The site must incorporate meet the following criteria:
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work 
- WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section 
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications 
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application 
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

Here is the layout of the site:
- Header: includes navigation to the other three sections and a link to a sample resume.
- Hero: a quick eye-catcher that give the why of the site
- About Me: a short introduction to who I am
- Work Portfolio: List of projects I have completed as I build my skills and experience.  Per the requirements, the first project is by design larger than the other projects.
- Contact Info: provides an avatar, phone number, email address, and GitHub link for me.
- Footer: copyright of page

The site incorporates flexboxes and media queries to improve site functionality across various devices and screen sizes.
